# Fundamentals of Software Architecture

## Types:

1) Solution Architect
  - Stays between the business area and the software
  - It is a technical area with a great vision of the business
  - Transform the business requirement into software solution
  - draw solution software architectures to reproduce how it will work 
  - C4, UML, BPMN
  - He will analyze the commercial impact when choosing a technology
  - Participate in commercial meetings of pre-sail or sail to show technical details
  - He can analyze costs to the business
2) Technology Architect:
  - A Specialty based in a specific technology
  - Ex: Elastic Architect (specialty in ElasticStack), Java Architect, SQL Server, SAP, Salesforce, etc.
3) Enterprise Architect
  - Impact the whole organization
  - Evaluation of new technologies to define which one will be used
  - Technology Standardization in the company
  - Big implementation planning
  - Cost Evaluation
  - Migrations
  - Core Systems of the company
  
4) Software Architect
  - A Software Engineering discipline
  - Directly relation to the software development
  - "Low Level"
  - Affects the Organization Structure: Team Formation, Software Components
  - How the software will be developed according to the team formation.
  - It is the relation between the goal business and their restrictions, with the components that will be created and the responsibilities, aiming the software evolution
  * Roles:
    - Transform business requirements into architecture pattern
    - Orchestrate devs and domain experts
    - Understand deeply concepts and architecture models
    - Assists in decision making when everything is not good
    - Reinforce good development practices
    - Code Review
  * Why should we learn?
    - Macro Vision
    - Understand all the options to decide which one is better
    - Think in long term
    - Taking Decisions not based in market "hypes"
    - Good project patterns, development and good practices
    - Clarify of the software impact in the company
    - Make decisions with confidence

## Architecture VS Design
  - Architecture: Global Scope, High Level (components, abstractions, etc)
  - Design: Local Scope (class responsibilities, patterns, etc)
  - Both go together. There is a discussion of what each one means.

## Sustainability
  - Software is expensive
  - Software has to be paid in long term
  - Software needs to follow the business evolution
  - The solution needs to be architected

## Pillars
  - Structure
  - Easy evolution to attend requirement business
  - Components
  - Systems relationship
  - Governance (patterns, rules, documentation, definitions, languages, protocols, systems to communicate)
    * If someone goes away from the company, the project cannot finish

## Architectural Requirements
  - Performance
  - Data storage
  - Scalability
  - Security
  - Legal (ex: LGPD)
  - Audit
  - Marketing
